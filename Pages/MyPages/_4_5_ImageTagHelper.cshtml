<!-- The query string named v is added to the image's URL if the append-version attribute is set to true. 
The value is calculated from the file contents, so if the file is amended, the value will differ. 
Browsers take query string values into account when 
determining whether a request can be satisfied from its cache. 
Therefore, if the query string value changes, 
the browser will retrieve the new version of the file from the server. -->
